        <p>Members of the board of the Office of Congressional Ethics shall file annual financial disclosure reports with the Clerk of the House on or before May 15 of each calendar year after any year in which they perform the duties of that position. Such reports shall be on a form prepared by the Clerk that is substantially similar to form 450 of the Office of Government Ethics. The Clerk shall send a copy of each such report filed with the Clerk within the seven-day period beginning on the date on which the report is filed to the Committee on Ethics and shall have them printed as a House document and made available to the public by August 1 of each year.</p>
        <note>
          <p>The original version of this rule (formerly rule XLIV) was adopted in the 90th Congress, in the same resolution that redefined the jurisdiction of the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct (now Ethics) (H. Res. 1099, Apr. 3, 1968, p. 8803). In the 91st Congress the rule was amended, effective for years after 1970, to require public disclosure of: (1) honoraria from a single source totaling $300 or more; and (2) each creditor to whom was owed an unsecured loan or other indebtedness of $10,000 or more outstanding for at least 90 days in the preceding calendar year (H. Res. 796, May 26, 1970, p. 17019). It was further amended in the 92d Congress to bring the Delegates and Resident Commissioner within the definition of “Members” in the final sentence of the rule (H. Res. 5, Jan. 22, 1971, p. 144; H. Res. 1153, Oct. 13, 1972, pp. 36021–23), and was amended in the 95th Congress to delete an obsolete reference (H. Res. 5, Jan. 4, 1977, pp. 53–70). The rule was completely amended in the 95th Congress, effective July 1, 1977, to: (1) broaden the sources and minimum amounts of income reported; (2) require reports to be filed with the Clerk as well as with the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct; and (3) make reports available to the public as printed House documents rather than having them maintained by the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct (H. Res. 287, Mar. 2, 1977, pp. 5933–53), but this last requirement was repealed in the 113th Congress (sec. 2(f), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2013, p. 26). The rule was again amended in the 96th Congress to incorporate by reference the relevant provisions of title I of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 as they pertain to Members, officers, and employees of the House (H. Res. 5, Jan. 15, 1979, pp. 7–16). Clause 1 was amended by the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 to make conforming changes in certain dates (P.L. 101–194). Before the House recodified its rules in the 106th Congress, this provision was found in former rule XLIV (H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47). This rule was redesignated as rule XXVI in the 107th Congress (sec. 2(s), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2001, p. 24). Clause 3 was added in the 110th Congress (H. Res. 895, Mar. 11, 2008, p. 3743). A gender-based reference was eliminated in the 111th Congress (sec. 2(l), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 2009, p. 7). This rule was amended in the 112th Congress to reflect a change in committee name (sec. 2(e)(8), H. Res. 5, Jan. 5, 2011, p. 80). Clause 3 was amended in the 114th Congress to replace an archaic reference to clause 1 with an August 1 deadline (sec. 2(h), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 2015, p. 35).</p>
          <p>For an in-depth discussion of this rule prepared by the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct (now Ethics), see the <i>House Ethics Manual</i> (110th Cong., 2d Sess.). For a requirement that the Clerk make financial disclosure reports available to the public in electronic form, see section 8 of the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012 (P.L. 112–105, as amended by P.L. 113–7).</p>
          <p>Pertinent provisions of title I of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App. 101–111) follow:</p>
