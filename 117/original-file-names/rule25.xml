          </paragraph>
          <note>
            <p>The rule on outside earned income (formerly rule XLVII) was adopted in the 95th Congress (H. Res. 287, Mar. 2, 1977, pp. 5933–53). It was amended for the first time in the 96th Congress to increase the limit on a single honorarium from $750 to $1000 (H. Res. 5, Jan. 15, 1979, pp. 7–16). The rule was amended further in the 97th Congress to: (1) increase the limitation on outside earned income for a calendar year from 15 to 30 percent of a Member’s salary; (2) strike the $1000 limitation on a single honorarium; and (3) provide that honoraria shall be attributable to the calendar year in which payment is received (H. Res. 305, Dec. 15, 1981, p. 31529). In the 99th Congress, the rule was amended to delete the 30 percent of aggregate salary limitation on outside earned income and to conform the limitation to that contained in law (2 U.S.C. 31–1 provides that a Member of Congress may not accept honoraria in excess of 40 percent of a Member’s aggregate salary) (H. Res. 427, Apr. 22, 1986, p. 8328). The next day, the House adopted a resolution vacating the proceedings by which that resolution had been adopted and laying that resolution on the table (Precedents (Wickham), ch. 5, §6.18). The Ethics Reform Act of 1989: (1) amended the title of the rule; (2) amended clause 1 to effect for 1991 and future years the elimination of honoraria not assigned to charity and closer restrictions on outside earned income (including limitation to 15 percent of Executive Level II pay); (3) amended clause 2 to effect for 1991 and future years new limits on outside employment; and (4) amended clause 3 to revise certain definitions (P.L. 101–194). That Act also established a civil cause of action against an individual who violates the limitations on outside earned income and employment (5 U.S.C. app. 504). In the 102d Congress clause 2 was further amended to specify that the ban on affiliation with a firm applies only if compensation is received and only with respect to a professional services firm, and clause 3 was further amended to specify the applicability of outside earned income restrictions to officers and employees of the House (H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 1991, p. 39). In the 104th Congress a new clause was added to prohibit the receipt of advance payments on copyright royalties and the receipt of any payments on copyright royalties under future contracts unless approved in advance by the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct (now Ethics) (H. Res. 299, Dec. 22, 1995, p. 38488). In the 106th Congress the rule was amended to permit certain House employees to receive honoraria; the parenthetical in clause 4(b) was adopted; and, when the House recodified its rules, it consolidated former rules XLI, XLVII, and LI under rule XXVI (H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47). This rule was redesignated as rule XXV in the 107th Congress (sec. 2(s), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2001, p. 24). Clause 4(a)(1) (and clause 5(e)) were amended in the 107th Congress to conform the definition of “officer or employee” to rule XXIII (sec. 2(w), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2001, p. 26). Clause 2 was amended in the 108th Congress to except the practice of medicine from the restriction against outside earned income received from providing professional services that involve a fiduciary relationship (sec. 2(q), H. Res. 5, Jan. 7, 2003, p. 7). Gender-based references were eliminated in the 111th Congress (sec. 2(l), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 2009, p. 7). Amendments were effected in the 112th Congress to reflect a change in committee name (sec. 2(e)(8), H. Res. 5, Jan. 5, 2011, p. 80).</p>
            <p>For an in-depth discussion of this rule prepared by the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct (now Ethics), see the <i>House Ethics Manual</i> (110th Cong., 2d Sess.).</p>
            <p>Before its coverage was restricted to the Senate in the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 (sec. 601(b), P.L. 101–194), a separate provision of law (2 U.S.C. 441i) provided criminal penalties for any elected or appointed Federal employee who accepts an honorarium of more than $2000 per speech. A statutory ceiling of $25,000 from honoraria in a calendar year was repealed in 1981 (P.L. 97–51). The Senate repealed its rule on outside earned income in the 97th Congress (S. Res. 512, Dec. 14, 1982, p. 30640) and reinstated it in the 102d Congress (S. Res. 192, Oct. 31, 1991, p. 29567).</p>
            <p>For provisions of the Federal criminal code restricting postemployment activities, see 18 U.S.C. 207, which was originally enacted in title V of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (P.L. 95–521).</p>

          <note>
            <p>This provision originally was adopted in the 104th Congress as rule LII (H. Res. 250, Nov. 16, 1995, p. 33433). It was amended in the 106th Congress to permit acceptance of a gift having a value of less than $50 and a cumulative value from any one source in the calendar year of less than $100 (H. Res. 9, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 237). In the 105th Congress it was redesignated as rule LI (H. Res. 5, Jan. 7, 1997, p. 121), and when the House recodified its rules in the 106th Congress, this provision was consolidated with former rules XLI and XLVIII under former rule XXVI (redesignated as rule XXV in the 107th Congress) (H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47). Clause 5(e) (now 5(g)) and clause 4(a)(1) were amended in the 107th Congress to conform the definition of “officer or employee” to rule XXIII (sec. 2(w), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2001, p. 26). In the 108th Congress clause 5(a)(1)(B) was amended to allocate the value of perishable food sent to an office among the individual recipients rather than to the Member (sec. 2(r), H. Res. 5, Jan. 7, 2003, p. 7) and clause 5(a)(4)(C) was amended to permit, under specified circumstances, a Member to be reimbursed for transportation and lodging to attend a charity event (sec. 2(s), H. Res. 5, Jan. 7, 2003, p. 7). In the 109th Congress, clause 5(b)(4)(D) was amended to expand the definition of “necessary transportation, lodging, and related expenses” to include travel expenses of a relative of a Member (rather than only a spouse or child) (sec. 2(j), H. Res. 5, Jan. 4, 2005, p. 43). In the 110th Congress, clause 5 was amended as follows: (1) to add subdivision (ii) to paragraph (a)(1)(A), with a corresponding cross reference in paragraph (a)(1)(B)(i); (2) to add subdivision (ii) to paragraph (a)(1)(B); (3) to include as gifts reimbursement for transportation and lodging expenses from entities that retain registered lobbyists or agents of a foreign principal in paragraph (b)(1)(A) with an exception in a new subdivision (C) for reimbursements from institutions of higher education or for participation in one-day events (effective March 1, 2007); (4) to shorten from 30 to 15 days the time in which disclosure is made to the Clerk under paragraph (b)(1)(A)(ii) (effective March 1, 2007); (5) to add subdivision (F) to paragraph (b)(3); (6) to make a conforming amendment to paragraph (b)(3) (effective March 1, 2007); (7) to include additional certifications and disclosures in paragraph (b)(5) (effective March 1, 2007); (8) to add paragraphs (c) and (d) (effective March 1, 2007); and (9) to add paragraph (i) (effective March 1, 2007). Subdivision (Q) was amended during the 110th Congress to clarify the events for which a gift of free attendance is not prohibited (sec. 4, H. Res. 437, May 24, 2007, p. 14156). In the 111th Congress a technical correction to paragraph (i)(2) was effected and gender-based references were eliminated (secs. 2(l), 2(m), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 2009, pp. 7, 9). Amendments were effected in the 112th Congress to reflect a change in committee name (sec. 2(e)(8), H. Res. 5, Jan. 5, 2011, p. 80). Paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), and (d)(1) were amended in the 117th Congress to permit electronic signatures (sec. 2(l)(4), H. Res. 8, Jan. 4, 2021, p. __).</p>
            <p id="s1101">The earliest form of the rule on “employment practices” was designated as rule LI. It grew out of the Fair Employment Practices Resolution first adopted in the 100th Congress (Precedents (Wickham), ch. 6, §28.1) and renewed in the 101st Congress (H. Res. 15, Jan. 3, 1989, p. 85). The terms of that resolution were incorporated by reference in a standing rule LI in the 102d Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 1991, p. 39), and were codified in full text, with certain amendments, in the 103d Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 5, 1993, p. 49). The Employment Practices rule was overtaken by the earliest form of “application of certain laws,” which was originally designated as LII in the 103d Congress (Precedents (Wickham), ch. 6, §28.2). The Application of Laws rule, in turn, was overtaken by the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (P.L. 104–1; 2 U.S.C. 1301). Certain savings provisions appear in section 506 of that Act (2 U.S.C. 1435). A later form of the rule designated as LII (gift rule) was adopted in the 104th Congress (H. Res. 250, Nov. 16, 1995, p. 33433). In the 105th Congress the Gift Rule was redesignated as rule LI (H. Res. 5, Jan. 7, 1997, p. 121).</p>

            <p>This provision was adopted in 1842 (V, 7227). It was renumbered January 3, 1953 (p. 24). It was amended by the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 to include employees in the prohibition against prosecuting or having an interest in any claim against the Government, to specify the inapplicability of that prohibition to the discharge of official duties, and to delete an obsolete reference to the Committee on House Administration (P.L. 101–194). Gender-based references were eliminated in the 111th Congress (sec. 2(l), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 2009, p. 7). Before the House recodified its rules in the 106th Congress, this provision was found in former rule XLI (H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47).</p>
