        <note>
          <p>This rule was transferred from rule XLIII to rule XXIV when the House recodified its rules in the 106th Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47). It was redesignated as rule XXIII in the 107th Congress (sec. 2(s), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2001, p. 24). The rule was originally adopted in the 90th Congress (H. Res. 1099, Apr. 3, 1968, p. 8803). The jurisdiction of the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct (now Ethics) was redefined in the same resolution. Clause 4 was entirely rewritten (and definitions for the purpose of clause 4 were deleted) in the 104th Congress to reflect the adoption of a Gift Rule (H. Res. 254, Nov. 30, 1995, p. 35077). Before the 104th Congress, clause 4 had been amended in the 95th Congress to change the prohibition against acceptance of gifts of “substantial value” (H. Res. 5, Jan. 4, 1975, p. 20) and definitions for purposes of clause 4 were added in the 95th Congress (H. Res. 287, Mar. 2, 1977, pp. 5933–53). Those definitions were amended in the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 to make conforming changes in the definition of “relative” (P.L. 101–194). Clause 4 was also amended: (1) in the 100th Congress to increase from $35 to $50 the value of personal hospitality of an individual that is not to be counted when computing the aggregate amount of gifts per calendar year (H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1987, p. 6); and (2) in the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 to revise the rules governing the acceptance of gifts, including value thresholds and waivers (P.L. 101–194). Those threshold and aggregate values were again adjusted by section 314(d) of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1992 (P.L. 102–90). The Ethics Reform Act of 1989 (P.L. 101–194) amended clause 5 to prohibit the acceptance of honoraria. Clause 6 was amended in the 95th Congress to delete from the second sentence the exception “unless specifically provided by law,” which had been added in the 94th Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 4, 1975, p. 20) and was again amended in the 109th Congress to conform it to the change in <ref href="rule24.xml#rule-XXIV-1">clause 1 of rule XXIV</ref> to permit campaign funds to be used to defray certain official expenses (sec. 2(j), H. Res. 5, Jan. 4, 2005, p. 43). Clause 6 was also amended by the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 (P.L. 101–194) to specify that campaign funds be used only for bona fide campaign or political purposes. Clause 7 was amended in the 95th Congress to eliminate an exception permitting sponsors to give notice of purpose (H. Res. 5, Jan. 4, 1975, p. 20). The Ethics Reform Act of 1989 (P.L. 101–194) amended clause 8 to broaden Members’ accountability for the pay and performance of staff. Clause 8 was again amended in the 106th Congress to permit telecommuting by House employees (H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47). Clause 8(c) was added in the 107th Congress (sec. 2(t), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2001, p. 24) and expanded in the 113th Congress to apply to a defined group of relatives instead of just spouses (sec. 2(e)(2), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2013, p. 26). Clause 9 was added in the 94th Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 14, 1975, p. 20). Clause 9 was amended: (1) in the 100th Congress to prohibit discrimination in employment based upon age (H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1987, p. 6); (2) in the 101st Congress to conform existing staff antidiscrimination rules to the Fair Employment Practices resolution adopted in the 100th Congress (now contained in the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (P.L. 104–1; 2 U.S.C. 1301; see <ref href="rule25.xml#s1101">§1101</ref>, <i>infra</i>)); (3) in the 115th Congress to include sexual harassment as a form of employment discrimination (sec. 5, H. Res. 724, Feb. 6, 2018, p. __); and (4) in the 116th Congress to prohibit discrimination in employment based upon sexual orientation or gender identity (sec. 102(ff), H. Res. 6, Jan. 3, 2019, p. __). Clause 10 was added in the 94th Congress (H. Res. 46, Apr. 16, 1975, p. 10340), and was amended in the 116th Congress to encourage resignation from committees upon indictment for certain criminal offenses (sec. 102(hh), H. Res. 6, Jan. 3, 2019, p. __). Clause 11 was added in the 96th Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 15, 1979, pp. 7–16). Clause 12 was added by the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 (P.L. 101–194) to proscribe certain contacts as involving conflicts of interest. Clause 13 was added in the 104th Congress (sec. 220, H. Res. 6, Jan. 4, 1995, p. 468), except the last sentence, which was added in the 107th Congress (sec. 2(t), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2001, p. 24). Clause 13 was amended in the 112th Congress to clarify that it does not require the disclosure of actual signatures (sec. 2(f), H. Res. 5, Jan. 5, 2011, p. 80) and in the 113th Congress to shift from the Clerk to the Sergeant-at-Arms some responsibility for the oath (sec. 2(e)(3), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2013, p. 26). Clause 22 (which was an undesignated paragraph at the end of the rule before being numbered as clause 14 when the rules were recodified in the 106th Congress) was amended in the 92d Congress to bring the Delegates and Resident Commissioner within the definition of “Member” (H. Res. 5, Jan. 22, 1971, p. 144; H. Res. 1153, Oct. 13, 1972, pp. 36021–23). It was again amended in the 106th Congress to include consultants among employees covered by certain provisions of the code of conduct (H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47) and in the 107th Congress to add the last two sentences of paragraph (b) (sec. 2(v), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2001, p. 24). Paragraph (b) was amended during the 110th Congress with regard to firms, partnerships, and other business organizations (sec. 303, P.L. 110–81). In the 105th Congress the rule was amended to effect three clerical corrections (H. Res. 5, Jan. 7, 1997, p. 121); in the 106th Congress clerical and stylistic changes were effected when the rules were recodified (H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47); in the 107th Congress conforming changes were made to reflect the redesignation of several rules (sec. 2(s), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2001, p. 24) and a clerical correction to a cross reference in clause 8(b) was effected (sec. 2(x), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2001, p. 26); and in the 112th Congress a technical change was made (sec. 2(f), H. Res. 5, Jan. 5, 2011, p. 80). Clauses 14 through 17 were added in the 110th Congress (secs. 202, 207, H. Res. 6, Jan. 4, 2007, p. 19; sec. 404(b), H. Res. 6, Jan. 4, 2007, p. 19 (adopted Jan. 5, 2007)). Clause 15 was amended in its entirety during the 110th Congress (H. Res. 363, May 2, 2007, p. 11119) and amended in the 113th Congress to expand paragraph (b) and add paragraph (c) (sec. 2(e)(4), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2013, p. 26). Clause 18 was added in the 115th Congress (sec. 6, H. Res. 724, p. __), and was amended in the 116th Congress to expand the prohibition to certain relationships involving employees of committees (sec. 102(gg), H. Res. 6, Jan. 3, 2019, p. __). Gender-based references were eliminated in the 111th Congress (sec. 2(l), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 2009, p. 7) and in the 117th Congress (sec. 2(d), H. Res. 8, Jan. 4, 2021, p. __). Clause 19 was added in the 116th Congress to restrict service by Members, Delegates, and the Resident Commissioner as an officer or director of a public company (sec. 102(ii), H. Res. 6, Jan. 3, 2019, p. __) and was amended in the 117th Congress to provide ongoing regulatory authority for the Committee on Ethics (sec. 2(x), H. Res. 8, Jan. 4, 2021, p. __). Clause 20 and 21 were added in the 117th Congress to emphasize whistleblower protection (sec. 2(y), H. Res. 8, Jan. 4, 2021, p. __). An amendment was effected in the 112th Congress to reflect a change in committee name (sec. 2(e)(8), H. Res. 5, Jan. 5, 2011, p. 80).</p>
          <p>For an in-depth discussion of this rule prepared by the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct (now Ethics), see the <i>House Ethics Manual</i> (110th Cong., 2d Sess.).</p>
          <p>It is not a proper parliamentary inquiry to ask the Chair to interpret the application of a criminal statute to a Member’s conduct, because it is for the House and not the Chair to judge the conduct of Members (Precedents (Wickham), ch. 5, §3.3). In response to a parliamentary inquiry, the Chair advised that the operation of clause 16 was not affected by a special order of the House waiving various points of order against a measure and against its consideration (Mar. 23, 2007, p. 7457). The Committee on Standards of Official Conduct (now Ethics) opined that “conviction” in clause 10 includes a plea of guilty or a certified finding of guilty even though sentencing may occur later (H. Rept. 94–76).</p>
          <p>The House in the 116th and 117th Congresses adopted the following separate orders: (1) requiring that non-disclosure agreements imposed by employing or contracting authorities in the House of Representatives include guidance that employees and contractors can communicate matters to the Committee on Ethics or Office of Congressional Workplace Rights (sec. 103(q), H. Res. 6, Jan. 3, 2019, p. __; sec. 3(f), H. Res. 8, Jan. 4, 2021, p. __); (2) prohibiting the Committee on House Admininstration from approving certain settlements of complaints against Members under the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 except with terms requiring the Member to reimburse the Treasury for the settlement amount (sec. 103(r), H. Res. 6, Jan. 3, 2019, p. __; sec. 3(g), H. Res. 8, Jan. 4, 2021, p. __); (3) requiring employing offices of the House to adopt an anti-harassment and anti-discrimination policy for the workplace (sec. 103(s), H. Res. 6, Jan. 3, 2019, p. __; sec. 3(h), H. Res. 8, Jan. 4, 2021, p. __); and (4) requiring the display in House employing offices of a statement of rights and protections under the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (sec. 103(t), H. Res. 6, Jan. 3, 2019, p. __; sec. 3(i), H. Res. 8, Jan. 4, 2021, p. __). In the 117th Congress the House required the Committee on Ethics to report any recommended changes to the Code of Official Conduct to address potential discipline for the intentionally misleading dissemination of distorted or manipulated electronic images, videos, or audio files (sec. 3(y), H. Res. 8, Jan. 4, 2021, p. __).</p>
