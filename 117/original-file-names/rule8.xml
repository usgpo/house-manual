      <clause id="rule-VIII-4">
        <num value="4">4.</num>
        <p>Nothing in this rule shall be construed to deprive, condition, or waive the constitutional or legal privileges or rights applicable or available at any time to a Member, Delegate, Resident Commissioner, officer, or employee of the House, or of the House itself, or the right of such Member, Delegate, Resident Commissioner, officer, or employee, or of the House itself, to assert such privileges or rights before a court in the United States.</p>
        <note>
          <p>Before the House recodified its rules in the 106th Congress, this provision was found in former rule L (H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47). It was added initially in the 97th Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 5, 1981, p. 98). Until the 95th Congress, whenever a Member, officer, or employee received a subpoena, the House would adopt a resolution authorizing the person to respond. In the 95th and 96th Congresses general authority was granted to respond to subpoenas without the necessity of a House vote (H. Res. 10, Jan. 4, 1977, p. 73; H. Res. 10, Jan. 15, 1979, p. 19). This standing authority was clarified and revised later in the 96th Congress (H. Res. 722, Sept. 17, 1980, pp. 25777–90) and formed the basis for the present rule. In the 107th Congress the rule was amended to broaden its application to administrative subpoenas (sec. 2(c), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2001, p. 25), but this change was reversed in the 115th Congress (sec. 2(k), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2017, p. __). The rule was re-written entirely in the 115th Congress to consolidate and clarify the notification process and eliminate a requirement that the Clerk transmit a copy of this rule to the court (sec. 2(k), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2017, p. __).</p>
          <p>In the 102d Congress the House considered as questions of the privileges of the House resolutions: responding to a subpoena for records of the “bank” in the Office of the Sergeant-at-Arms (Precedents (Wickham), ch. 6, §26.3); responding to a contemporaneous request for such records from a Special Counsel (Precedents (Wickham), ch. 6, §26.3); and authorizing an officer of the House to release certain documents in response to another such request from the Special Counsel (Precedents (Wickham), ch. 6, §26.6).</p>
          <p>A response to an administrative subpoena also raises a question of the privileges of the House (Deschler, ch. 11, §14.8). A Member or employee receiving such a subpoena may inform the House (July 30, 1998, p. 18298; May 3, 1999, p. 8040).</p>
          <p>Although clause 2 requires the Speaker to promptly lay before the House a communication notifying the Speaker of the receipt of a subpoena, the rule does not require that the text of a subpoena be printed in the Record (July 31, 1992, p. 20602).</p>
