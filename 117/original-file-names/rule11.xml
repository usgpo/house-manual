            <note>
              <p>This paragraph was first adopted December 8, 1931, to provide that the Rules of the House are the rules of the standing committees (without reference to subcommittees) and to provide for a privileged motion to recess from day to day (VIII, 2215). The paragraph was amended March 23, 1955, when the House adopted rules governing committee investigations that are now embodied in clause 2 (pp. 3569–3585). In the 92d Congress paragraph (a) was amended in the form contained in the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 (84 Stat. 1140) to specifically address subcommittees (H. Res. 5, Jan. 22, 1971, p. 144). It was amended again in the 99th Congress to allow a privileged motion to dispense with the first reading of a measure if printed copies are available (H. Res. 7, Jan. 3, 1985, p. 393). Clerical and stylistic changes were effected when the House recodified its rules in the 106th Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47). In the 109th Congress paragraph (a) was reorganized and amended to provide for a privileged motion to recess subject to the call of the chair (within 24 hours) (sec. 2(d), H. Res. 5, Jan. 4, 2005, p. 43). For the requirement in Jefferson’s Manual that a bill or resolution be read in full upon demand, before being read by paragraphs or sections for amendment, see <ref href="jefferson.xml#s412">§412</ref>, <i>supra</i>.</p>
              <p>Each committee may appoint subcommittees (VI, 532), which should include majority and minority representation (IV, 4551), and confer on them powers delegated to the committee itself (VI, 532) except such powers as are reserved to the full committee by the Rules of the House; but express authority also has been given subcommittees by the House (III, 1754–1759, 1801, 2499, 2504, 2508, 2517; IV, 4548).</p>
              <p>As indicated in §369, <i>supra</i>, clause 1(a)(1)(A) enables standing and select committees to enforce in committee applicable House rules of decorum, such as <ref href="rule1.xml#rule-I-2">clause 2 of rule I</ref> and rule XVII.</p>

Paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), and (b)(4) were added in the 105th Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 7, 1997, p. 121). Clerical and stylistic changes were effected when the House recodified its rules in the 106th Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47). Subparagraph (4) was amended in the 114th Congress to include dissenting views to mirror an amendment to clause 2(l) (sec. 2(a)(5), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 2015, p. 34).</p>

In the 105th and 106th Congresses, it was amended to update a reference to the “contingent fund” (H. Res. 5, Jan. 7, 1997, p. 121; H.

            </subparagraph>
            <note>
              <p>The provisions of paragraph (d)(1) were first made requirements of the rules in the 92d Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 22, 1971, p. 144, incorporating the provisions of sec. 118(b) of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 (84 Stat. 1140)), and effective on January 3, 1975 (H. Res. 988, 93d Cong., Oct. 8, 1974, p. 34470), exemptions from the reporting requirements for the Committees on Appropriations, the Budget, House Administration, Rules, and Ethics (formerly Standards of Official Conduct) were removed, so the paragraph from that point applied to all committees. The 104th Congress added what is now subparagraph (2) to require that activity reports include separate sections on legislative and oversight activities, including a summary comparison of oversight plans and eventual recommendations and actions (sec. 203(b), H. Res. 6, Jan. 4, 1995, p. 467) which requirement for a summary comparison was modified in the 115th Congress to reflect the addition of authorization and oversight plans in <ref href="rule10.xml#rule-X-2-d">clause 2(d) of rule X</ref> (sec. 2(b), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2017, p. __), and again in the 116th Congress to reflect a return to oversight plans in that same clause (sec. 102(j), H. Res. 6, Jan. 3, 2019, p. __). What is now subparagraph (3) was added in the 105th Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 7, 1997, p. 121). Clerical and stylistic changes were effected when the House recodified its rules in the 106th Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47). In the 111th Congress, the House amended subparagraph (2) to require the inclusion of hearings under paragraphs (n), (o), and (p) of this clause in the oversight section of activities reports (H. Res. 40, Jan. 14, 2009, p. 757), and eliminated a gender-based reference (sec. 2(l), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 2009, p. 7). In the 112th Congress, the paragraph was rewritten entirely to clarify late-session filing and to increase from biennial to semiannual the frequency of reports (sec. 2(e)(13), H. Res. 5, Jan. 5, 2011, p. 80), which was reduced to annual in the 113th Congress (sec. 2(a), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2013, p. 25) and back to biennial in the 114th Congress (sec. 2(a)(4), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 2015, p. 34). Subparagraph (3)(B) was amended in the 114th Congress to include dissenting views to mirror an amendment to clause 2(l) (sec. 2(a)(5), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 2015, p. 34).</p>
              <p>Under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, the Committee on Rules is required to include in its activity report a separate item identifying all waivers of points of order relating to Federal mandates, listed by bill or joint resolution number and subject matter (sec. 107(b), P.L. 104–4; 109 Stat. 63).</p>

            <note>
              <p>The requirement that standing committees adopt written rules was first incorporated into the rules in the 92d Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 22, 1971, p. 144), having been included in the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 (84 Stat. 1140). Under the Committee Reform Amendments of 1974, clause 2(a) became effective in essentially its present form on January 3, 1975 (H. Res. 988, 93d Cong., Oct. 8, 1974, p. 34470). In the 94th Congress it was amended to permit a record vote to close the committee meeting at which committee rules are adopted only on the day of the meeting (H. Res. 5, Jan. 14, 1975, p. 20). In the 102d Congress it was amended to allow a committee 30 days after the election of its members, rather than after the convening of the Congress, to publish its rules in the Congressional Record (H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 1991, p. 39). The provision requiring publication of committee rules in the Congressional Record derived from statute (2 U.S.C. 190a–2 (repealed 1979)). A court interpreted that statute to be mandatory in a case in which a Senate committee failed to publish in the Record a rule regarding a quorum for the purpose of taking sworn testimony. In overturning a perjury conviction, the court held that the unpublished committee rule was not valid. United States <i>v.</i> Reinecke, 524 F.2d 435 (D.C. Cir. 1975). Clerical and stylistic changes were effected when the House recodified its rules in the 106th Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47). Subparagraph (2) was amended in the 112th Congress to require committee rules to also be publicly available in electronic form, and to begin the day-count for submission from the election of the chair (vice the committee) (sec. 2(c)(8), H. Res. 5, Jan. 5, 2011, p. 80). Subparagraph (3) was added in the 109th Congress (sec. 2(d), H. Res. 5, Jan. 4, 2005, p. 43). Subparagraph (1)(D) was added in the 114th Congress when this requirement was removed from clause 4(f) (sec. 2(a)(6), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 2015, p. 34). Subparagraph (2) was amended in the 116th Congress to allow a committee 60 days (instead of 30) to submit its rules for publication in the Congressional Record after the election of the chair (sec. 102(n), H. Res. 6, Jan. 3, 2019, p. __) Gender-based references were eliminated in the 111th Congress (sec. 2(l), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 2009, p. 7).</p>
              <p>Committees have historically adopted rules under which they function (I, 707; III, 1841, 1842; VIII, 2214). It is the responsibility of the committees, and not the House, to construe and enforce additional committee rules on the calling of committee meetings (Speaker Albert, July 22, 1974, pp. 24436, 24437). This provision requires a select committee to publish its adopted rules in the Record (June 25, 1998, p. 14014).</p>
              <p id="s792">Failure to follow certain procedural requirements imposed on committees by this rule may invalidate committee actions. Violation of the requirements as to open meetings and hearings and other hearing irregularities improperly overruled (see <ref idref="rule-XI-2-g-5">clause 2(g)(5) of rule XI</ref>) or the prescribed committee procedures for reporting bills and resolutions (<ref idref="rule-XI-2-h">clause 2(h) of rule XI</ref>) may in some instances be the basis for a point of order in the House, resulting in the recommittal of the bill. However, a point of order does not ordinarily lie in the House against consideration of a bill by reason of defective committee procedures occurring before the time the bill is ordered reported to the House (Procedure, ch. 17, §11.1).</p>
              <p>Many of the procedures applicable to committees derive from Jefferson’s Manual, which governs the House and its committees in all cases to which it is applicable (<ref href="rule29.xml#rule-XXIX-1">clause 1 of rule XXIX</ref>). A committee may act only when together, and not by separate consultation and consent, nothing being the report (or recommendation) of the committee except what has been agreed to in committee actually assembled (see Jefferson’s Manual at §407, <i>supra</i>). A measure before a committee for consideration must be read for amendment by section as in the House (see Jefferson’s Manual at §§412–414, <i>supra</i>), and reading of the measure and of amendments thereto must be in full. The procedures applicable in the House as in the Committee of the Whole (see <ref href="jefferson.xml#s424">§§424</ref>, 427, <i>supra</i>) generally apply to proceedings in committees of the House of Representatives, except that because a measure considered in committee must be read for amendment, a motion to limit debate under the five-minute rule in committee must be confined to the portion of the bill then pending. The motion for the previous question may be applied to a question under debate in committee when it has been read (or considered as read) for amendment in its entirety.</p>
              <p>Committees generally conduct their business under the five-minute rule but may employ the ordinary motions that are in order in the House, such as under <ref href="rule16.xml#rule-XVI-4">clause 4 of rule XVI</ref>.</p>
              <p>In the 116th and 117th Congresses the House adopted provisions, effective during a designated public health emergency, permitting committees to conduct proceedings remotely and to allow committee members to participate remotely during in-person committee proceedings, including by casting their votes or recording their presence remotely. In addition, such provisions: (1) permitted committee chairs to declare a recess subject to the call of the chair at any time to address technical difficulties with remote proceedings; (2) deemed electronic versions of motions, amendments, measures or other documents to satisfy all requirements under the rules for printed or written documents during committee proceedings; and (3) deemed remote proceedings to satisfy all requirements under the rules related to broadcasting and audio and visual coverage (sec. 4, H. Res. 965, May 15, 2020, p. __; sec. 3(s), H. Res. 8, Jan. 4, 2021, p. __). In the 117th Congress, a requirement that committees notify the Speaker in writing of the satisfaction of certain prerequisites prior to conducting remote proceedings was eliminated (sec. 3(s)(2), H. Res. 8, Jan. 4, 2021, p. __).</p>

              <note>
                <p>The first sentence of paragraph (e)(1) was rewritten entirely in the 104th Congress (sec. 206, H. Res. 6, Jan. 4, 1995, p. 475). Its predecessor, requiring a complete record of all committee actions, including votes on any question on which a roll call was demanded, was enacted as section 133(b) of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 (60 Stat. 812) and made part of the standing rules on January 3, 1953 (p. 24). The requirement that committee roll calls be subject to public inspection was added by section 104(b) of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 (84 Stat. 1140) and made a part of the rules in the 92d Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 22, 1971, p. 144). The qualified exception for the Committee on Ethics (formerly Standards of Official Conduct) from the requirement of public availability of record votes was added in the 105th Congress (sec. 8, H. Res. 168, Sept. 18, 1997, p. 19336). Effective on January 3, 1975 (H. Res. 988, 93d Cong., Oct. 8, 1974, p. 34470), the requirement that proxy votes in committee be made available for public inspection was eliminated from this paragraph because proxies were prohibited as of that date, but in the 94th Congress <ref idref="rule-XI-2-f">clause 2(f) of rule XI</ref> was amended to permit proxies in committee, and this paragraph was likewise amended to reinsert the requirement of availability for public inspection (H. Res. 5, Jan. 14, 1975, p. 20). When proxy voting was again eliminated in the 104th Congress, the reference thereto in the third sentence of paragraph (e)(1) was deleted (sec. 104(b), H. Res. 6, Jan. 4, 1995, p. 463). Paragraph (e)(1) was amended in the 112th Congress to require that record votes be electronically available within 48 hours (sec. 2(c)(5), H. Res. 5, Jan. 5, 2011, p. 80) and amended in the 113th Congress to effect a technical correction (sec. 2(f), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2013, p. 26). Paragraph (e)(1) was further amended in the 117th Congress to eliminate the requirement that the record be made available for inspection in committee offices and to effect an additional technical correction (sec. 2(i), H. Res. 8, Jan. 4, 2021, p. __). Paragraph (e)(2) derives from section 202(d) of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 (60 Stat. 812), was made a part of the rules in the 83d Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 1953, p. 24), was amended in the 95th Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 4, 1977, pp. 53–70) to restrict the access of Members to certain records of the Committee on Ethics (formerly Standards of Official Conduct), and was amended in the 113th Congress to effect a technical correction (sec. 2(f), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2013, p. 26). Paragraph (e)(3) was added in the 101st Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 1989, p. 72). Paragraph (e)(4) was added in the 105th Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 7, 1997, p. 121). Subparagraphs (5) and (6) were added in the 112th Congress (secs. 2(c)(6), 2(c)(9), H. Res. 5, Jan. 5, 2011, p. 80), and subparagraph (6) was amended in the 117th Congress to expand the availability requirement to any amendment disposed of or withdrawn (sec. 2(j), H. Res. 8, Jan. 4, 2021, p. __). Clerical and stylistic changes were effected when the House recodified its rules in the 106th Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47). A gender-based reference was eliminated in the 111th Congress (sec. 2(l), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 2009, p. 7). This paragraph was amended in the 112th Congress to reflect a change in committee name (sec. 2(e)(8), H. Res. 5, Jan. 5, 2011, p. 80).</p>
                <p>Although all Members have access to committee records under this paragraph, it is not without qualification. Committees may prescribe regulations to govern the manner of access to their records, such as requiring examination only in committee rooms. In addition, this paragraph: (1) does not give a Member the right to make photostatic copies of such records (Speaker Rayburn, Aug. 14, 1957, pp. 14737–39), and such records may not be brought into the well of the House if the committee has not authorized such action (Speaker Rayburn, June 3, 1960, p. 11820); (2) does not necessarily apply to records within the possession of the executive branch that the members of the committee have been allowed to examine under limited conditions at the discretion of the executive agency in possession of such materials (Speaker O’Neill, July 31, 1980, p. 20765); (3) does not apply to records (an executive communication not yet referred to committee) in the possession of the House (Sept. 9, 1998, p. 19769). In the 105th Congress the House adopted a resolution restricting Members’ access to documents received from an independent counsel (said to relate to possible grounds for impeachment of the President) and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary (H. Res. 525, Sept. 11, 1998, p. 20020).</p>
                <p>Testimony or evidence taken in executive sessions of a committee is under the control and subject to the regulation of the committee and, under paragraph (k)(7) (<ref href="#s803">§803</ref>, <i>infra</i>), cannot be released without the consent of the committee (June 26, 1961, p. 11233; see also Deschler, ch. 17, §18). Furthermore, such access allows a Member to examine executive session materials only in committee rooms and does not permit a Member to copy or to take personal notes from such materials, to keep such notes or copies in personal office files, or to release such materials to the public without the consent of the committee or subcommittee under paragraph (k)(7) (Speaker O’Neill, Dec. 6, 1977, pp. 38470–73). Compare this paragraph with <ref href="rule10.xml#rule-X-11-g-3">clause 11(g)(3) of rule X</ref>, which only permits access of nonmembers of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to classified information in the possession of that committee when authorized by that committee. A resolution directing a standing committee to release executive-session material referred to it by special rule of the House was held to propose a change in the rules and, therefore, not to constitute a question of the privileges of the House under rule IX (Sept. 23, 1998, p. 21562).</p>

                <p>The 104th Congress adopted paragraph (f) in this form (sec. 104, H. Res. 6, Jan. 4, 1995, p. 463). An earlier form of the provision was enacted as section 106(b) of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 (84 Stat. 1140) and made part of the standing rules in the 92d Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 22, 1971, p. 144). Clerical and stylistic changes were effected when the House recodified its rules in the 106th Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47).</p>
                <p>The original form of this paragraph permitted committees to adopt written rules permitting proxies in writing, designating the persons to execute them and specifying the measures or matters to which they applied. Effective January 3, 1975 (H. Res. 988, 93d Cong., Oct. 8, 1974, p. 34470), proxies in committee were prohibited, but in the 94th Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 14, 1975, p. 20), the rule was amended to permit proxies in committees with additional restrictions requiring an assertion that the grantor was absent on official business or otherwise unable to attend, requiring the Member to sign and date the proxy, and permitting general proxies for procedural matters.</p>

              </subparagraph>
              <note>
                <p>Subparagraphs (1) and (2), relating to open committee meetings and hearings, were first made part of the rules on March 7, 1973 (H. Res. 259, 93d Cong., pp. 6713–20). They were amended in the 94th Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 14, 1975, p. 20), to limit to one day (in the case of a meeting) or to one day plus one subsequent day (in the case of a hearing) the period during which a committee may close its session. They were again amended in the 95th Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 4, 1977, pp. 53–70) to require that a majority (rather than a quorum) be present when a committee or subcommittee votes to close a meeting or hearing and to provide that a noncommittee Member cannot be excluded from a hearing except by a vote of the House. However, subparagraph (2) was amended in the 96th Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 15, 1979, p. 8) to permit a majority of those present under the rules of the committee for the purpose of taking testimony (not less than two members as provided in <ref idref="rule-XI-2-h-2">clause 2(h)(2) of rule XI</ref>) to vote to close a hearing either to discuss whether the testimony would endanger national security or would violate clause 2(k)(5) of this rule, or to proceed to close the hearing as provided by clause 2(k)(5). In the 98th Congress subparagraph (2) was amended further to permit the Committees on Appropriations and Armed Services, and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and their subcommittees, when voting in open session with a quorum present, to close a hearing on that particular day and for up to five additional days, for a total of not to exceed six days (H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 1983, p. 34), an authority extended to the Committee on Homeland Security in the 115th Congress (sec. 2(m), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2017, p. __). In the 104th Congress the paragraph was amended to require that meetings and hearings open to the public also be open to broadcast and photographic media; subparagraph (2) was further amended to permit closed meetings only on specified conditions and to delete an exception for meetings relating to internal budget or personnel matters and to specify a new condition (sensitive law enforcement information) for closing hearings (sec. 105, H. Res. 6, Jan. 4, 1995, p. 463). The paragraph was also amended to conform references to renamed committees (sec. 202(b), H. Res. 6, Jan. 4, 1995, p. 467; H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47). In the 105th Congress subparagraphs (1) and (2) were again amended to reflect an amendment to former clause 4(e)(3) of rule X (currently <ref idref="rule-XI-3">clause 3 of rule XI</ref>) requiring meetings of the Committee on Ethics to occur in executive session (except for adjudicatory subcommittee meetings or full committee sanction hearings) unless opened by an affirmative vote of a majority of members (sec. 5, H. Res. 168, Sept. 18, 1997, p. 19336). Subparagraphs (3), (5), (6), and (7) derive from sections 111(b), 113(b), 115(b), and 242(c) respectively of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 (84 Stat. 1140) and became part of the rules in the 92d Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 22, 1971, p. 144). Effective January 3, 1975 (H. Res. 988, 93d Cong., Oct. 8, 1974, p. 34470), these provisions were inadvertently omitted from the rules, and were therefore reinserted in the 94th Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 14, 1975, p. 20).</p>
                <p>Subparagraph (3) was amended as follows: in the 97th Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 5, 1981, pp. 98–113) to add the requirement of prompt entering of public notice of committee hearings into the committee scheduling service of the House Information Resources; in the 104th Congress to permit the calling of a hearing on less than seven days’ notice upon a determination of good cause either by vote of the committee or subcommittee or by its chair with the concurrence of its ranking minority member (H. Res. 43, Jan. 31, 1995, p. 3028); in the 112th Congress to apply the notice requirement to meetings (sec. 2(c)(3), H. Res. 5, Jan. 5, 2011, p. 80); and in the 116th Congress to exclude weekends and legal holidays from counting under the meeting notice requirement (sec. 102(o), H. Res. 6, Jan. 3, 2019, p. __).</p>
                <p>A new subparagraph (4) was inserted (and subsequent subparagraphs redesignated) in the 112th Congress to require availability of committee markup text (sec. 2(c)(4), H. Res. 5, Jan. 5, 2011, p. 80). In the 105th and 106th Congresses subparagraphs (3) and (2) (respectively) were amended to effect a technical correction (H. Res. 5, Jan. 7, 1997, p. 121; H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47).</p>
                <p>Subparagraph (5) (then subparagraph (4)) was rewritten in the 105th Congress to encourage committees to elicit curricula vitae and disclosures of certain interests from nongovernmental witnesses (H. Res. 5, Jan. 7, 1997, p. 121), in the 112th Congress to require electronic availability of such disclosures and enable redactions for witness privacy (sec. 2(c)(7), H. Res. 5, Jan. 5, 2011, p. 80), in the 114th Congress to require the disclosure of contracts or payments from foreign governments, to confine the disclosure to the subject matter of the hearing, and to enable redactions for witness security (sec. 2(a)(1), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 2015, p. 34), and in the 117th Congress to require the disclosure of certain fiduciary interests, to extend the disclosure requirement for certain contracts and payments from the previous two calendar years to 36 months, to expand the foreign payments disclosure requirement to include grants, and to direct committees to make public the required information 24 hours prior to the witness’s appearance before the committee (sec. 2(k), H. Res. 8, Jan. 4, 2021, p. __).</p>
                <p>Clerical and stylistic changes were effected when the House recodified its rules in the 106th Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47). Gender-based references were eliminated in the 111th Congress (sec. 2(l), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 2009, p. 7). This paragraph was amended in the 112th Congress to reflect a change in committee name (sec. 2(e)(8), H. Res. 5, Jan. 5, 2011, p. 80).</p>
                <p>In the 105th Congress the House adopted a resolution restricting access to meetings and hearings held by the Committee on the Judiciary on a communication received from an independent counsel relating to possible grounds for impeachment of the President (H. Res. 525, Sept. 11, 1998, p. 20020).</p>
                <p>In the 116th and 117th Congresses, the House adopted provisions, effective during a designated public health emergency, deeming committee proceedings conducted remotely in accordance with regulations promulgated by the chair of the Committee on Rules to: (1) be considered open to the public; (2) satisfy requirements for non-participatory attendance under subparagraph (2)(C); and (3) satisfy notice requirements for “place” for purposes of subparagraph (3) (sec. 4, H. Res. 965, May 15, 2020, p. __; sec. 3(s), H. Res. 8, Jan. 4, 2021, p. __).</p>

                <p id="s799">A measure or recommendation may not be reported by a committee unless a majority of the committee is actually present.</p>
                <note>
                  <p>This subparagraph is from section 133(d) of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 (60 Stat. 812) and was made a part of the rules on January 3, 1953 (p. 24). Before the House recodified its rules in the 106th Congress, this provision was found in former clause 2(l)(2)(A) of rule XI (H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47). The point of order that a bill was reported from a committee without a formal meeting and a quorum present comes too late if debate has started on a bill in the House (VIII, 2223; Feb. 24, 1947, p. 1374). No committee report is valid unless authorized with a quorum of the committee actually present at the time the vote is taken (IV, 4584; VIII, 2211, 2212, 2221, 2222), and although Speakers have indicated that committee members may come and go during the course of the vote if the roll call indicates that a quorum was present (VIII, 2222), where it is admitted that a quorum was not in the room at any time during the vote and the committee transcript does not show a quorum acting as a quorum, the Chair will sustain the point of order (VIII, 2212). In the 103d Congress, this provision was amended to provide that responses to roll calls in committee be deemed contemporaneous and to require that a point of no quorum with respect to a committee report be timely asserted in committee or considered waived (H. Res. 5, Jan. 5, 1993, p. 49), but in the 104th Congress both of those features were deleted from the rule (sec. 207, H. Res. 6, Jan. 4, 1995, p. 467).</p>
                  <p>Where the committee transcript was not conclusive and the manager of the bill gave absolute assurance that a majority of the full committee was actually present when the bill was ordered reported the Speaker overruled a point of order made under this provision (Oct. 22, 1987, p. 28807). A point of no quorum pending a committee vote on ordering a measure reported may provoke a quorum call requiring a majority of the committee to be present in the committee room. A committee may act only when together, nothing being the report of the committee except what has been agreed to in committee actually assembled (see Jefferson’s Manual at §407, <i>supra</i>).</p>
                  <p>In the 116th and 117th Congresses the House adopted a provision, effective during a designated public health emergency, to count for purposes of establishing a quorum during committee proceedings all Members participating remotely (sec. 4(a)(4), H. Res. 965, May 15, 2020, p. __; sec. 3(s), H. Res. 8, Jan. 4, 2021, p. __).</p>

                <p>Subparagraphs (2) and (3) (formerly subparagraphs (1) and (2)) were adopted in the 84th Congress and only related to the authority of a committee to fix a quorum of not less than two for taking testimony (H. Res. 151, Mar. 23, 1955, pp. 3569, 3585). In the 95th Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 4, 1977, pp. 53–70) subparagraph (3) (formerly subparagraph (2)) was added to authorize committees to fix a quorum less than a majority for certain other action. Before the House recodified its rules in the 106th Congress, paragraph (h) consisted only of subparagraphs (2) and (3) (H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47). Subparagraph (3) was amended in the 107th Congress to preserve all requirements for a majority quorum found in House rules (sec. 2(i), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2001, p. 25).</p>
                <p>Authority for a committee (other than the Committee on Oversight and Reform under <ref href="rule10.xml#rule-X-4-c">clause 4(c) of rule X</ref>) to conduct depositions or interrogatories before one member or staff of the committee must be specifically conferred by the House (see, <i>e.g.</i>, Oct. 13, 1988, p. 30467; H. Res. 167, 105th Cong., June 20, 1997, p. 11677). Such authority was granted to four committees in the 114th Congress (sec. 3(b), H.

              <p id="s801">A committee may not sit during a joint session of the House and Senate or during a recess when a joint meeting of the House and Senate is in progress.</p>
              <note>
                <p>This prohibition was added in the 101st Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 1989, p. 72). Other limitations on committee sittings, removed from this paragraph in the 105th Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 7, 1997, p. 121), had their origins in a separate clause in 1794. That clause was omitted from rule XI in the adoption of rules for the 80th Congress but remained effective as part of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, the applicable provisions of which were continued as a part of the Rules of the House. It prohibited committees from sitting at any time when the House was in session, but was narrowed to proscribe sittings during the five-minute rule by the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 (sec. 117(b); 84 Stat. 1140) and this revision was made part of the standing rules in the 92d Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 22, 1971, p. 144). Effective January 3, 1975 (H. Res. 988, 93d Cong., Oct. 8, 1974, p. 34470), the Committees on Appropriations, the Budget, and Rules were exempted; and in the 95th Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 4, 1977, pp. 53–70), the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct was also exempted. The Committee on Ways and Means was traditionally permitted to sit during proceedings under the five-minute rule by unanimous consent granted each Congress (Jan. 29, 1975, p. 1677) until it was exempted in the 97th Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 5, 1981, pp. 98–113). A provision that special leave to sit be granted if ten Members did not object was added in the 95th Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 4, 1977, pp. 53–70). An exemption for the Committee on House Administration was added in the 101st Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 1989, p. 72). In the 103d Congress the prohibition against sitting during proceedings under the five-minute rule was stricken altogether (H. Res. 5, Jan. 5, 1993, p. 49), but in the 104th Congress the former rule was reinstated with exemptions for the Committees on Appropriations, the Budget, Rules, Standards of Official Conduct, and Ways and Means, and also with provision for a privileged motion by the Majority Leader (sec. 208, H. Res. 6, Jan. 4, 1995, p. 467), who controlled one hour of debate thereon (Jan. 23, 1995, p. 2209). Clerical and stylistic changes were effected when the House recodified its rules in the 106th Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47).</p>

                <p>Paragraph (j)(1) was contained in section 114(b) of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 (84 Stat. 1140) and was made a part of the rules in the 92d Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 22, 1971, p. 144). Paragraph (j)(2) was added to the rules on that latter date. Although a majority of the minority members of a committee are entitled to call witnesses selected by the minority for at least one day of hearings, no rule of the House requires the calling of witnesses on opposing sides of an issue (Oct. 14, 1987, p. 27921). In the 105th Congress paragraph (j)(2) was redesignated as (2)(A) and two new subparagraphs were added as (2)(B) and (2)(C) to enable committees to permit extended examinations of witnesses by designated members or by staff (H. Res. 5, Jan. 7, 1997, p. 121). A technical correction was effected in the 106th Congress to clarify the procedure to extend questioning, and clerical and stylistic changes were effected when the House recodified its rules in the same Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47). A gender-based reference was eliminated in the 111th Congress (sec. 2(l), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 2009, p. 7). In the 114th Congress a select committee was permitted to increase from five to ten minutes the time for questioning a witness under subparagraph (2)(A) (sec. 4(a), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 2015, p. 37).</p>

              <note>
                <p>The provisions of paragraph (k) were first incorporated into the rules in the 84th Congress (H. Res. 151, Mar. 23, 1955, pp. 3569, 3585). The requirement of subparagraph (2) that a copy of committee rules be furnished to each witness was added in the 92d Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 22, 1971, p. 144) and was amended in the 107th Congress to require the committee to furnish such rules only when the witness so requests (sec. 2(j), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2001, p. 25). The former requirement of subparagraph (9) that a witness pay the cost of a transcript copy of testimony was eliminated under the Committee Reform Amendments of 1974, effective January 3, 1975 (H. Res. 988, 93d Cong., Oct. 8, 1974, p. 34470). Subparagraph (5) was amended in the 96th Congress to permit a committee or subcommittee to hear testimony asserted to be defamatory in executive session upon a determination by a majority of those present that such testimony is indeed defamatory, degrading, or incriminating (H. Res. 5, Jan. 15, 1979, pp. 7–16), in the 105th Congress to clarify a majority of those voting (a full quorum being present) may decide to proceed in open session (H. Res. 5, Jan. 7, 1997, p. 121), and in the 107th Congress to permit such an assertion to be made by the witness (with respect to that witness) or a member of the committee (with respect to any person) (sec. 2(j), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2001, p. 25). Clerical and stylistic changes were effected when the House recodified its rules in the 106th Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47). “Investigative” was removed from the heading and subparagraphs (1), (3), and (5) in the 107th Congress to conform the rule to House practice, which is to apply this paragraph to all committee hearings (sec. 2(j), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2001, p. 25). Gender-based references were eliminated in the 111th Congress (sec. 2(l), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 2009, p. 7).</p>
                <p>The requirements of paragraphs (g)(1) and (2), and of paragraph (m)(2)(A), that a majority of the committee or subcommittee shall constitute a quorum for the purposes of closing meetings or hearings or issuing subpoenas have been construed to require, under paragraph (k)(7) of this rule, that a majority shall likewise constitute a quorum to release or make public any evidence or testimony received in any closed meeting or hearing and any other executive session record of the committee or subcommittee. See also clauses 11(c) and 11(g) of rule X, which provide that classified material transmitted by the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to another committee of the House becomes the executive session material of the recipient committee by virtue of the nature of the material and the injunction of <ref href="rule10.xml#rule-X-11-g">clause 11(g) of rule X</ref>, which prohibits disclosure of information provided to committees or Members of the House except in a secret session.

                <p>In the 116th and 117th Congresses, the House adopted a provision, effective during a designated public health emergency, permitting witnesses and their counsel to appear remotely at committee proceedings (sec. 4, H. Res. 965, May 15, 2020, p. __; sec. 3(s), H. Res. 8, Jan. 4, 2021, p. __).</p>

                <p>This provision was originally included in section 107 of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 (84 Stat. 1140) and was incorporated into the rules in the 92d Congress (H.

In the 105th Congress it was amended to reduce the guaranteed time for composing separate views from three full days to two full days after the day of notice (H. Res. 5, Jan. 7, 1997, p. 121). In the 113th Congress it was amended to clarify that notice inures to all committee members (sec. 2(f), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2013, p. 26). It was amended in the 114th Congress to include dissenting views (sec. 2(a)(5), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 2015, p. 34). In the 117th Congress, it was amended to permit signatures on written and signed views to be filed with committee clerks in electronic form (sec. 2(l)(1), H.

              <note>
                <p>Before the adoption of clause 2(m) under the Committee Reform Amendments of 1974, effective January 3, 1975 (H. Res. 988, 93d Cong., Oct. 8, 1974, p. 34470), only the Committees on Appropriations, the Budget, Government Operations, Internal Security, and Standards of Official Conduct were permitted by the standing rules to perform the functions as specified in subparagraphs (1)(A) and (1)(B), and other standing and select committees were given those authorities by separate resolutions reported from the Committee on Rules each Congress. In the 94th Congress the paragraph was amended to require authorized subpoenas to be signed by the chair of the full committee or any member designated by the committee (H. Res. 5, Jan. 14, 1975, p. 20). In the 95th Congress the paragraph was amended to permit a subcommittee, as well as a full committee, to authorize subpoenas and to allow a full committee to delegate such authority to the chair of the full committee (H. Res. 5, Jan. 4, 1977, pp. 53–70). The special rule for authorizing and issuing a subpoena of a subcommittee of the Committee on Ethics (formerly Standards of Official Conduct) was adopted in the 105th Congress (sec. 15, H. Res. 168, Sept. 18, 1997, p. 19319). In the 106th Congress subparagraph (3)(B) was added, and clerical and stylistic changes were effected when the House recodified its rules in the same Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47). A clerical correction was effected to paragraph (m)(1) in the 107th Congress to correct a cross reference (sec. 2(x), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2001, p. 26). Gender-based references were eliminated in the 111th Congress (sec. 2(l), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 2009, p. 7). This paragraph was amended in the 112th Congress to reflect a change in committee name (sec. 2(e)(8), H. Res. 5, Jan. 5, 2011, p. 80). Subparagraph (3)(D) was added in the 117th Congress (sec. 2(m), H. Res. 8, Jan. 4, 2021, p. __).</p>
                <p>A subpoena issued under this clause need only be signed by the chair of the committee or by any member designated by the committee, whereas when the House issues an order or warrant the Speaker must under <ref href="rule1.xml#rule-I-4">clause 4 of rule I</ref> issue the summons under the Speaker’s hand and seal, and it must be attested by the Clerk pursuant to <ref href="rule2.xml#rule-II-2-d">clause 2(d) of rule II</ref> (formerly clause 3 of rule III) (III, 1668; see H. Rept. 96–1078, p. 22). During the 116th and 117th Congresses, the House authorized electronic signature of subpoenas and electronic attestation and affixation of a seal by the Clerk during the pendency of a designated public health emergency (sec. 4(f), H. Res. 965, May 15, 2020, p. __; sec. 3(s), H. Res. 8, Jan. 4, 2021, p. __). A statute empowers the chair of the Committee of the Whole, the Speaker, chairs of joint, select, or standing committees, and Members to administer oaths to witnesses (2 U.S.C. 191; III, 1769).</p>
                <p>Although under this clause the Committee on Ethics may issue subpoenas in investigating the conduct of a Member, officer, or employee of the House (the extent of the committee’s jurisdiction under rule X and functions under <ref idref="rule-XI-3">clause 3 of rule XI</ref>), where the House authorizes an investigation by that committee of other persons not directly associated with the House, the committee’s jurisdiction is thereby enlarged and a broader subpoena authority must be conferred on the committee (Mar. 3, 1976, p. 5165). Subparagraph (3)(C) (formerly subparagraph (2)(B)) has been interpreted to require authorization by the full House before a subcommittee chair could intervene in a lawsuit in order to gain access to documents subpoenaed by the subcommittee. <i>In re</i> Beef Industry Antitrust Litigation, 589 F.2d 786 (5th Cir. 1979). The authority conferred in clause 2(m)(1)(B) to require information “by subpoena or otherwise” has not been interpreted to authorize depositions or interrogatories. Except in the case of the Committee on Oversight and Reform under <ref href="rule10.xml#rule-X-4-c">clause 4(c) of rule X</ref>, such authority must be conferred by separate action of the House (see, <i>e.g.</i>, Dec. 5, 2007, p. 32250; sec. 3(b), H. Res. 8, Jan. 3, 2021, p. __).</p>
                <p>In the 116th and 117th Congresses the House adopted provisions, effective during a designated public health emergency, to: (1) satisfy the requirement of a “place” for purposes of subparagraph (1); and (2) permit the administration of the oath to a witness remotely for purposes of subparagraph (2) (sec. 4, H. Res. 965, May 15, 2020, p. __; sec. 3(s), H. Res. 8, Jan. 4, 2021, p. __).</p>
                <p>In the 117th Congress the House authorized the issuance of subpoenas by certain committee and subcommittee chairs with respect to specified investigations prior to the adoption of committee rules for subpoena issuance (sec. 3(q), H. Res. 8, Jan. 4, 2021, p. __).</p>

Res. 6, Jan. 3, 2019, p. __), and in the 117th Congress, the House continued such provision while allowing each subcommittee of a standing committee (other than a subcommittee on oversight) to satisfy such requirement (sec. 3(a), H. Res. 8, Jan. 4, 2021, p. __).</p>

            <note>
              <p>The investigative authority contained in this provision (formerly clause 4(e) of rule X) was first conferred upon the committee in the 90th Congress (H. Res. 1099, Apr. 3, 1968, p. 8802). Effective January 3, 1975, the former requirement in paragraph (b)(1)(A) (formerly clause 4(e)(2)(A) of rule X) that not less than seven committee members authorize an investigation was changed to permit a majority of the committee to provide that authorization (H. Res. 988, 93d Cong., Oct. 8, 1974, p. 34470). That provision was further amended in the 105th Congress to permit the chair and ranking minority member, with respect to a properly filed complaint, to gather additional information or to establish an investigative subcommittee (sec. 11, H. Res. 168, Sept. 18, 1997, p. 19318). Paragraph (b)(5) (formerly clause 4(e)(2)(E) of rule X) was added in the 95th Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 4, 1977, pp. 53–70) to provide a mechanism for a committee member to seek disqualification from participating in an investigation, and paragraph (b)(6) (formerly clause 4(e)(2)(F) of rule X) was added in the 96th Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 15, 1979, p. 8). For an example of a disqualification letter, see February 17, 2012, p. 2059.</p>
              <p>This provision was amended in several particulars by the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 (P.L. 101–194): (1) paragraph (a)(1) (formerly clause 4(e)(1)(A) of rule X) was amended to enable a letter of reproval or other administrative action of the committee to be implemented as part of a report to the House, with no action required of the House; (2) paragraph (a)(2) (formerly clause 4(e)(1)(B) of rule X) was amended to require the committee to report to the House its findings of fact and any recommendations respecting the final disposition of a matter in which it votes to undertake an investigation; (3) a new paragraph (a)(4) (formerly clause 4(e)(1)(E) of rule X) was added to empower the committee to consider requests that the rule restricting the acceptance of gifts be waived in exceptional circumstances; and (4) paragraph (b)(3) (formerly clause 4(e)(2)(C) of rule X) was amended to set a general limitation on actions for committee consideration of ethics matters.</p>
              <p>In the beginning of the 105th Congress a subparagraph (3) was added at the end of former clause 4(e) of rule X to establish a Select Committee on Ethics only to resolve a specific inquiry originally undertaken by the standing Committee on Standards of Official Conduct in the 104th Congress but not concluded (H. Res. 5, Jan. 7, 1997, p. 121). The select committee filed one report to the House (H. Rept. 105–1, H. Res. 31, Jan. 21, 1997, p. 393). The current form of paragraph (c) (formerly clause 4(e)(3) of rule X) was adopted later in the 105th Congress (sec. 5, H. Res. 168, Sept. 18, 1997, p. 19318).</p>
              <p>Additional amendments to this provision were adopted in the 105th Congress as follows: (1) paragraphs (d) and (e) (formerly clauses 4(e)(4) and 4(e)(5)) were adopted (sec. 6 and sec. 19, H. Res. 168, Sept. 18, 1997, pp. 19318, 19320); (2) paragraph (b)(2) (formerly clause 4(e)(2)(B) of rule X) was amended to address the disposition of a complaint after expiration of periods set forth in the committee rules and to specify parameters for the filing of complaints by non-Members (sec. 11, H. Res. 168, Sept. 18, 1997, p. 19318); and (3) paragraph (a)(3) (formerly clause 4(e)(1)(C) of rule X) was amended to permit the committee to report to the appropriate authorities substantial evidence of a violation of law by an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members of the committee without the approval of the House (sec. 18, H. Res. 168, Sept. 18, 1997, p. 19320). Paragraph (a)(5) was amended in the 107th Congress to reflect the redesignation of a rule (sec. 2(s), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2001, p. 24). Paragraph (a)(6) was added in the 110th Congress, effective March 1, 2007 (sec. 211, H. Res. 6, Jan. 4, 2007, p. 19). Paragraphs (b)(2)(C) and (b)(8) were added in the 110th Congress (H. Res. 895, Mar. 11, 2008, p. 3471). Gender-based references were eliminated in the 111th Congress, and paragraph (b)(5) was amended to clarify the disqualification process (sec. 2(l), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 2009, p. 7). Amendments were effected in the 112th Congress to reflect a change in committee name (sec. 2(e)(8), H. Res. 5, Jan. 5, 2011, p. 80). Paragraph (b)(8) was amended in the 113th Congress to clarify the circumstances in which certain public statements are not required to be made (sec. 2(e)(1), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2013, p. 26). Paragraph (a)(6)(B)(i) was amended in the 114th Congress to include new Members, Delegates, and the Resident Commissioner (sec. 2(g), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 2015, p. 35). Paragraph (a)(6)(B)(ii) was amended in the 116th Congress (sec. 102(p), H. Res. 6, Jan. 3, 2019, p. __) and paragraph (b)(8) was amended in the 117th Congress (sec. 2(n)(2), H. Res. 8, Jan. 4, 2021, p. __) to include Delegates, and the Resident Commissioner. Before the House recodified its rules in the 106th Congress, this provision was found in former clause 4(e) of rule X and paragraph (b)(7) was found in former clause 1(p) of rule X (H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47).</p>
              <p>In the 110th through 113th Congresses and in the 116th and 117th Congresses, the House directed the committee to empanel an investigative subcommittee upon a Member being indicted or otherwise formally charged with criminal conduct, or to report to the House if it decides not to so empanel a subcommittee (H. Res. 451, June 5, 2007, p. 14605; sec. 4(e), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 2009, p. 7; sec. 4(d), H. Res. 5, Jan. 5, 2011, p. 80; sec. 4(e), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2013, p. 28; sec. 103(k), H. Res. 6, Jan. 3, 2019, p. __; sec. 3(e), H. Res. 8, Jan. 4, 2021, p. __).</p>
              <p>In the 110th Congress, the House established an independent Office of Congressional Ethics to investigate individually-initiated alleged ethics violations and to report its recommendations to the committee (Mar. 11, 2008, p. 3741).

            <note>
              <p>In the 105th Congress a 12-member bipartisan task force was informally appointed by the Majority and Minority Leaders to conduct a comprehensive review of the House ethics process. At the same time an order of the House was adopted imposing a moratorium on filing or processing ethics complaints and on raising certain questions of privilege under rule IX with respect to official conduct. The moratorium was imposed with the expectation that the recommendations of the task force would include changes relating to the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct (now Ethics) and the process by which the House enforces standards of official conduct (Feb. 12, 1997, p. 2058). The moratorium was extended through September 10, 1997 (July 30, 1997, p. 16958). On September 18, 1997, the House adopted the recommendations of the task force with certain amendments (H. Res. 168, 105th Cong., p. 19340), which included not only changes to the standing rules of the House but also free-standing directives to the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, which were reaffirmed for the 106th Congress (sec. 2(c), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47) and again for the 107th Congress with an exception to section 13 (sec. 3(a), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2001, p. 24). In the 108th Congress the pertinent free-standing provisions were codified (including the exception to section 13 added in the 107th Congress) as new paragraphs (f) through (q) of clause 3 (sec. 2(h), H. Res. 5, Jan. 7, 2003, p. 7). On the opening day of the 109th Congress, various changes were made to paragraphs (b), (k), (p), and (q) (sec. 2(k), H. Res. 5, Jan. 4, 2005, p. 43). Later in the 109th Congress, those changes were redacted and the affected provisions as they existed at the close of the 108th Congress were reinstated (H. Res. 240, Apr. 27, 2005, p. 8045). Paragraph (r) was added in the 110th Congress (H. Res. 895, Mar. 11, 2008, p. 3741). Gender-based references were eliminated in the 111th Congress (sec. 2(l), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 2009, p. 7). A technical amendment to paragraph (o)(2) was effected in the 112th Congress (sec. 2(f), H. Res. 5, Jan. 5, 2011, p. 80). An erroneous designation in paragraph (h) was corrected in the 113th Congress (sec. 2(f), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2013, p. 26). Paragraph (s) was added in the 114th Congress (sec. 2(a)(10), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 2015, p. 34). Paragraph (p) was amended in the 116th Congress to permit the committee to adopt rules related to the use of certain trial evidence during its investigations (sec. 102(q), H. Res. 6, Jan. 3, 2019, p. __). Paragraphs (k), (m), (n), and (r) were amended in the 117th Congress to clarify the inclusion of Delegates and the Resident Commissioner (sec. 2(n)(2), H. Res. 8, Jan. 4, 2021, p. __).</p>
              <p>Section 803 of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 (2 U.S.C. 4711) contains several free-standing provisions, which are carried in this annotation. The requirement that the respective party caucuses nominate seven majority and seven minority members should be read in light of <ref href="rule10.xml#rule-X-5">clause 5 of rule X</ref>, setting the composition of the committee at 10, five from the majority and five from the minority. The requirement that the committee adopt rules establishing investigative and adjudicative subcommittees should be read in light of clause 3(m), which constitutes the same requirement. The references to <ref idref="rule-XI-5-d">clause 5(d) of rule XI</ref> applied to a former rule regarding minority staffing requirements, which was eliminated in the 104th Congress (sec. 101(c)(5), H. Res. 6, Jan. 4, 1995, p. 462).</p>

              <p>On occasions in which the House has directed the committee to conduct specific investigations by separate resolution, it has authorized the committee to take depositions with one member present, notwithstanding clause 2(h), to serve subpoenas, to participate by special counsel in relevant judicial proceedings (see H. Res. 252, 95th Cong., Feb. 9, 1977, pp. 3966–75; H. Res. 608, Mar. 27, 1980, pp. 6995–98; H. Res. 254, June 30, 1983, p. 18279), and to investigate persons other than Members, officers and employees with expanded subpoena authority (see H. Res. 1054, 94th Cong., Mar. 3, 1976, pp. 5165–68). By unanimous consent the committee was authorized to receive evidence and take testimony before a quorum of one of its members for the remainder of the second session of the 100th Congress (Oct. 13, 1988, p. 30467). By resolutions considered as questions of the privileges of the House, the committee has been directed to investigate illegal solicitation of political contributions in the House Office Building by unnamed sitting Members (July 10, 1985, p. 18397); to review GAO audits of the operations of the “bank” in the Office of the Sergeant-at-Arms (Oct. 3, 1991, p. 25435), to disclose the names and pertinent account information of Members and former Members found to have abused the privileges of that entity (Mar. 12, 1992, p. 5519), and to disclose further account information respecting Members and former Members having checks held by that entity (Mar. 12, 1992, p. 5534); and to investigate violations of confidentiality by staff engaged in the investigation of the operation and management of the Office of the Postmaster (July 22, 1992, p. 18786). In compliance with one such direction of the House, the acting chair of the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct (now Ethics) inserted in the Record names and pertinent account information of Members and former Members found to have abused the privileges of the “bank” in the Office of the Sergeant-at-Arms (Precedents (Wickham), ch. 5, §22.20). In the 106th Congress the chair of the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct inserted in the Record an explanation of the committee’s amendment to committee rule 20(f) to reflect that the full committee retains discretion whether to report to the House that an investigative subcommittee has not adopted a statement of alleged violation (Apr. 13, 2000, p. 5631).</p>
              <p>Under clause 3(b)(4) (formerly clause 4(e)(2)(D) of rule X), a member of the Committee on Ethics is ineligible to participate in a committee proceeding relating to that member’s official conduct. Upon notification to the Speaker of such ineligibility, the Speaker designates another Member of the same political party as the ineligible member to serve on the committee during proceedings relating to that conduct (Speaker O’Neill, Feb. 5, 1980, p. 1908; July 23, 1996, p. 18596). Under clause 3(b)(5) (formerly clause 4(e)(2)(E) of rule X), a member of the committee may be recused from serving on the committee during proceedings relating to a pending investigation by submitting an affidavit of disqualification to the committee stating that the member cannot render an impartial and unbiased decision relating to that investigation. If the committee accepts the affidavit, the chair notifies the Speaker and requests the Speaker to designate another Member from the same political party as the disqualified member to serve on the committee during proceedings relating to that investigation (Speaker O’Neill, Mar. 18, 1980, p. 5752; Feb. 17, 2012, p. 2059).</p>
              <p>The committee has compiled statutory and rule-based ethical standards in the <i>House Ethics Manual</i> (110th Cong., 2d Sess.). In the <i>Manual</i>, the committee incorporates its advisory opinions issued under clause 3(a)(4) (formerly clause 4(e)(1)(D) of rule X), together with advisory opinions issued by the former Select Committee on Ethics, in its discussions of various ethical issues, including gifts, outside income, financial disclosure, staff rights and duties, official allowances and franking, casework considerations, campaign financing and practices, and involvement with official and unofficial organizations. The committee is required to issue interpretive guidance regarding the prohibition on use of nonpublic information for private profit (sec. 3, P.L. 112–105).</p>

            <p>The rule permitting broadcasting of committee hearings was contained in section 116(b) of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 (84 Stat. 1140) and became part of the rules in the 92d Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 22, 1971, p. 144). In the 93d Congress, the rule was amended to permit committees to adopt rules allowing coverage of committee meetings as well as hearings (H. Res. 1107, July 22, 1974, p. 24447). Paragraphs (e), (f)(3), (f)(5), and (f)(8) of this clause were amended in the 99th Congress to remove the limit on the number of television cameras (previously four) and press photographers (previously five) covering committee proceedings, and to provide the committee or subcommittee chair with the discretion to determine the appropriate number (H. Res. 7, Jan. 3, 1985, p. 393). At the beginning of the 104th Congress paragraph (d) was amended to delete the former characterization of broadcast and photographic coverage of committee meetings and hearings as “a privilege made available by the House,” and paragraph (e) was amended to eliminate the requirement that a committee vote to permit broadcast and photographic coverage of open hearings and meetings and to prohibit chairs from limiting coverage to less than two representatives from each medium, except if space or safety considerations warrant pool coverage (sec. 105, H. Res. 6, Jan. 4, 1995, p. 463). Later in the 104th Congress this clause was again amended to make conforming changes in its heading and in paragraph (f) (H. Res. 254, Nov. 30, 1995, p. 35077). Former clause 4(f)(2), permitting a witness to terminate audio and visual (including photographic) coverage, was eliminated in the 105th Congress (H. Res. 301, Nov. 12, 1997, p. 26041). Gender-based references were eliminated in the 111th Congress (sec. 2(l), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 2009, p. 7). Paragraph (f)(7) was amended in the 112th Congress to remove obsolete references to news organizations (sec. 2(e)(3), H. Res. 5, Jan. 5, 2011, p. 80). The requirement that committees adopt rules implementing this clause was transferred from clause 4(f) to clause 2(a)(1) in the 114th Congress (sec. 2(a)(6), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 2015, p. 34). Paragraph (b) was amended in the 114th Congress to conform the restriction on use of coverage to <ref href="rule5.xml#rule-V-2-c-1">clause 2(c)(1) of rule V</ref> (sec. 2(a)(7), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 2015, p. 34), and was further amended in the 117th Congress to modernize the types of coverage subject to such restriction (sec. 2(o), H. Res. 8, Jan. 4, 2021, p. __). Before the House recodified its rules in the 106th Congress, this provision was found in former clause 3 of rule XI (H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47).</p>
            <p>In the 116th and 117th Congresses, the House adopted provisions, effective during a designated public health emergency, deeming remote proceedings to satisfy all requirements under this clause for broadcasting and audio and visual coverage (sec. 4(e)(3), H. Res. 965, May 15, 2020, p. __; sec. 3(s), H. Res. 8, Jan. 4, 2021, p. __).</p>

          <p id="s813">Witnesses appearing before the House or any of its committees shall be paid the same per diem rate as established, authorized, and regulated by the Committee on House Administration for Members, Delegates, the Resident Commissioner, and employees of the House, plus actual expenses of travel to or from the place of examination. Such per diem may not be paid when a witness has been summoned at the place of examination.</p>
          <note>
            <p>This clause (formerly rule XXXV) was adopted in 1872, with amendments in 1880 (III, 1825), 1930 (VI, 393), and on April 19, 1955 (p. 4722), August 12, 1969 (H. Res. 495, 91st Cong., p. 23355), and July 28, 1975 (H. Res. 517, 94th Cong. p. 25258). The last amendment eliminated the specific per diem and travel rate of reimbursement and allowed actual travel costs and per diem for witnesses requested or subpoenaed to appear at the same rate as established by the Committee on House Administration for Members and employees. In the 104th and 106th Congresses it was amended to conform references to a renamed committee (sec. 202(b), H. Res. 6, Jan. 4, 1995, p. 467; H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47). Before the House recodified its rules in the 106th Congress, this provision was found in former rule XXXV (H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47). For further provisions relating to witnesses, see clauses 2(j) and (k) of rule XI (<ref href="#s802">§§802</ref>–803, <i>supra</i>).</p>
            <p>Regulations of the Committee on House Administration do not permit per diem reimbursement for witnesses. Regulations for reimbursement of actual travel costs may be found in the Committees’ Congressional Handbook, Committee on House Administration, under the section entitled “Hearings and Meetings.”</p>

          <p id="s814">All business of the House at the end of one session shall be resumed at the commencement of the next session of the same Congress in the same manner as if no adjournment had taken place.</p>
          <note>
            <p>At first the Congress attempted to follow the rule of the English Parliament that business unfinished in one session should begin anew at the next; but in 1818, after an investigation of a joint committee in 1816, a rule was adopted that House bills remaining undetermined in the House should be continued at the next session after six days. This rule did not reach House bills sent to the Senate; but in 1848 the two Houses remedied this omission by a joint rule. Business referred to committees of the House was still subject to the old rule of Parliament; but in 1860 the present rule was adopted as a supplement to the rule of 1818. In 1890, desiring to do away with the limitation of the six days and apparently overlooking the main purpose of the rule of 1818, the House rescinded that limitation. Also, in 1876 the joint rules were abrogated, leaving no provision, except the headline of the rule, for the continuance of business not before committees. The practice, however, had become so well established that no question has ever been raised (V, 6727). Before the House recodified its rules in the 106th Congress, this provision was found in former rule XXVI (H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47).</p>
            <p>The business of conferences between the two Houses is not interrupted by an adjournment of a session that does not terminate the Congress (V, 6260–6262), and if one House asks a conference at one session the other may agree to it in the next session (V, 6286). Where bills were enrolled and signed by the presiding officers of the two Houses at the close of one session they were sent to the President and approved at the beginning of the next session (IV, 3486–3488).</p>
