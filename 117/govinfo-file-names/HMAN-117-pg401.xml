            <p>When the House recodified its rules in the 106th Congress, it consolidated former rules XXXI, XXXII, and XXXIII under rule IV, and clause 1 was found in former rule XXXI (H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47). Rules relating to the use of the Hall were adopted as early as 1804. The present form of this clause dates from 1880 (V, 7270). It was renumbered January 3, 1953 (p. 24). A technical amendment to this clause, in conjunction with one to clause 2(b), was effected in the 112th Congress (sec. 2(f), H. Res. 5, Jan. 5, 2011, p. 80). The Speaker has announced standards for use of the Chamber when the House is not in session (Speaker Pelosi, Jan. 6, 2009, p. 25; Speaker Boehner, Jan. 5, 2011, 106; Speaker Boehner, Jan. 3, 2013, p. 47; Speaker Boehner, Jan. 6, 2015, p. 63; Speaker Ryan, Jan. 3, 2017, p. __; Speaker Pelosi, Jan. 3, 2019, p. __; Speaker Pelosi, Jan. 4, 2021, p. __).</p>

          <note>
            <p>Before the House recodified its rules in the 106th Congress, this provision was found in former clause 1 of rule XXXII (H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47). It was subjected to many changes from 1802 until 1880 (V, 7283; VIII, 3634) and was renumbered in the 83d Congress (Jan. 3, 1953, p. 24). The rule was amended in the 92d Congress to include the Delegate from the District of Columbia among those having the privilege of the floor (H. Res. 5, Jan. 22, 1971, p. 144), and later in that Congress was revised to grant all Delegates the privilege (H. Res. 1153, Oct. 13, 1972, pp. 36021–23). The latter revision was necessary because of the enactment of Public Law 92–271, which created the positions of Delegate from Guam and Delegate from the Virgin Islands. Officers and elected employees, both present and former, were given floor privileges by the adoption of this same resolution (H. Res. 1153, Oct. 13, 1972, p. 36013) but had in fact, by custom, been permitted on the floor before this change. This clause was substantially amended in the 94th Congress (H. Res. 1435, Oct. 1, 1976, pp. 35175–80) and was amended by the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 to permit floor privileges for one attorney for a Member-respondent during consideration of a disciplinary resolution (P.L. 101–194, Nov. 30, 1989). Clause 2(a)(7) was amended in the 108th Congress to extend floor privileges to party leadership staff when so assigned with the approval of the Speaker (sec. 2(d), H. Res. 5, Jan. 7, 2003, p. 7). This amendment codified current practice, including the Speaker’s ultimate control over such assignments. In the 112th Congress, paragraph (a)(16) was amended to reflect a change in committee name and paragraph (b) was amended to clarify the breadth of the restriction on suspending various prohibitions of rule IV, which had been unintentionally narrowed by recodification in the 106th Congress (secs. 2(e)(8), 2(f)(2), H. Res. 5, Jan. 5, 2011, p. 80). In the 116th Congress, paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) were amended to clarify that Delegates-elect and the Resident Commissioner-elect, as well as contestants in election cases for Delegate or the Resident Commissioner, have floor privileges, and paragraph (a)(14) was amended to extend such privileges to Governors of the Territories (sec. 102(d), H. Res. 6, Jan. 3, 2019, p. __). Paragraph (a)(14) was further amended in the 117th Congress to extend such privileges to the Mayor of the District of Columbia (sec. 2(d)(1), H. Res. 8, Jan. 4, 2021, p. __).</p>
            <p>The portion of this clause that permits clerks of committees access to the floor during the consideration of business from their committees has been interpreted by the Speaker to allow four professional staff members and one clerk on the floor at one time (Speaker Albert, June 8, 1972, p. 20318; Speaker O’Neill, Precedents (Wickham), ch. 4, §5.5). The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970, section 503(3) (84 Stat. 1140, 1202; 2 U.S.C. 281b(3)), also allows two staff members of the Legislative Counsel access to the floor to assist the committee.</p>
            <p>The portion of the clause forbidding the Speaker to entertain requests for suspension of certain clauses applies also to the chair of the Committee of the Whole (V, 7285) but the House may grant specific access by resolution (<i>e.g.</i>, Precedents (Wickham), ch. 4, §1.7) and has likewise governed admittance for a specified joint meeting by resolution (Precedents (Wickham), ch. 4, §5.2). “Heads of departments” means members of the President’s Cabinet, and not subordinate executive officers, and “foreign ministers” means ministers from foreign governments only.</p>
            <p>An alleged violation of the rule relating to admission to the floor presents a question of privilege (III, 2624, 2625; VI, 579), but not a higher question of privilege than an election case (III, 2626). In one case in which a former Member was abusing the privilege, he was excluded by direction of the Speaker (V, 7288), but in another case the Speaker declared it a matter for the House and not the Chair to consider (V, 7286). In one case an alleged abuse was inquired into by a select committee (V, 7287). See <ref href="#s680">§680</ref>, <i>infra</i>, for the rule constraining conduct of former Members, Delegates, the Resident Commissioner, officers, and staff while on the floor. The Speaker announced an intention to strictly enforce the rule to prevent a proliferation of committee and other staff on the floor (Aug. 22, 1974, p. 30027; Precedents (Wickham), ch. 4, §5.6; Precedents (Wickham), ch. 6, §15.8). The Speaker announced that committee staff would be required to display staff badges on the floor in exchange for identification cards before admission to the floor (Speaker O’Neill, Precedents (Wickham), ch. 4, §5.8; Jan. 5, 1993, p. 105). It is not in order to refer to persons on the floor of the House as guests of the House, such as Members’ children (Apr. 28, 1994, p. 8783; Dec. 19, 1995, p. 37575; Jan. 22, 1996, p. 682; Apr. 30, 1998, p. 7320; June 17, 2004, p. 12847; Aug. 1, 2011, p. 12698) or other children (May 18, 1995, p. 13490; Oct. 7, 1999, p. 24425; Apr. 25, 2013, pp. 5952, 5953; Apr. 21, 2016, p. __; Apr. 26, 2018, p. __).</p>

          </paragraph>
          <note>
            <p>Before the House recodified its rules in the 106th Congress, this provision was found in former clause 3 of rule XXXII (H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47). It was adopted during the 94th Congress (H. Res. 1435, Oct. 1, 1976, pp. 35175–80) to: (1) consolidate in one place and to clarify the restrictions on admittance to the floor of former Members, officers, and employees; (2) add the restriction now found in paragraph (a)(3); and (3) give the Speaker the power to promulgate regulations to enforce the rule. During the 109th Congress, the clause was amended to: (1) add paragraph (a)(1) to establish plainer proscriptions with respect to registered lobbyists, agents of foreign principals, and persons with similar representational roles; and (2) specify particular exercises of regulatory authority by the Speaker (Precedents (Wickham), ch. 4, §6.7). The 111th Congress clarified the authority of the Speaker over the entire rule and not merely the exemptions specified in paragraph (b), and eliminated a gender-based reference (secs. 2(l), 2(m), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 2009, pp. 7, 9). During the 117th Congress, paragraph (a)(4) expanded the proscription on the privileges of the floor to include individuals convicted for crimes related to that individual’s election or service to the House (sec. 2(d)(2), H. Res. 8, Jan. 4, 2021, p. __). Pursuant to the authority granted by this clause, Speakers have issued regulations from time to time (Speaker O’Neill, Precedents (Wickham), ch. 4, §6.2; Speaker Foley, June 9, 1994, p. 12387; Speaker Gingrich, May 24, 1995, p. 14300; Speaker Gingrich, Aug. 1, 1996, p. 21031; Speaker Hastert, Feb. 1, 2006, p. 644; Speaker Pelosi, Jan. 5, 2007, p. 273).</p>
            <p>The Speaker has emphasized that this clause applies not only to the floor but also to “rooms leading thereto,” and has construed the latter phrase to include, for example, the Speaker’s Lobby and the cloakrooms (Speaker Rayburn, Oct. 2, 1945, p. 9251; Speaker Gingrich, May 24, 1995, p. 14300; Aug. 1, 1996, p. 21031) and the Rayburn Room (Feb. 1, 2006, p. 541).</p>
            <p>Even before the addition of what is now paragraph (a)(3), the Speaker advised that former Members did not have the privilege of the floor if they were in the employ of an organization that was interested in legislation before the Congress (Speaker Rayburn, Oct. 2, 1945, p. 9251). A former Member has not been entitled to the privileges of the floor under this clause if (1) having a direct personal or pecuniary interest in legislation under consideration in the House or reported by any committee, or (2) representing any party or organization for the purpose of influencing the disposition of legislation pending before the House, reported by any committee or under consideration in any committee or subcommittee (Precedents (Wickham), ch. 4, §6.3). The essence of the rule has been the former Member’s status as one with a personal or pecuniary interest and not whether the former Member may have a present intent to lobby (Speaker Foley, Precedents (Wickham), ch. 4, §6.4). Even before the adoption of a more categorical form of the rule during the 109th Congress, intent to lobby was assumed if a former Member was employed or retained as a lobbyist to influence legislative measures as described in (2) above (Aug. 1, 1996, p. 21031).</p>
            <p>A former Member must observe the rules of proper decorum while on the floor, and the Chair may direct the Sergeant-at-Arms to assist the Chair in maintaining such decorum (Sept. 17, 1997, pp. 19026, 19027). A former Member may not manifest approval or disapproval of the proceedings (VIII, 3635). In the 105th Congress the House adopted a resolution offered as a question of the privileges of the House alleging indecorous behavior of a former Member and instructing the Sergeant-at-Arms to ban the former Member from the floor, and rooms leading thereto, until the resolution of a contested election to which he was party (H. Res. 233, Sept. 18, 1997, p. 19340).</p>

          <p id="s681">A person from the staff of a Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner may be admitted to the Hall of the House or rooms leading thereto under clause 2 only upon prior notice to the Speaker.

Such persons are admitted only to advise the Member, Delegate, Resident Commissioner, or committee responsible for their admission. A person who violates this clause may be excluded during the session from the Hall of the House and rooms leading thereto by the Speaker.</p>
          <note>
            <p>Before the House recodified its rules in the 106th Congress, this provision was found in former clause 4 of rule XXXII (H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47). This clause was added initially in the 95th Congress (H. Res. 5, Jan. 4, 1977, pp. 53–70) to extend the privilege of the floor to one person from the staff of a Member having an amendment under consideration (but not of a measure’s sponsor), and was amended in the 115th Congress to remove a requirement that personal and committee staff remain at the committee tables (sec. 2(i), H. Res. 5, Jan. 3, 2017, p. __). The Speaker promulgated regulations for the implementation of this clause in the 95th Congress (January 26, 1977, p. 2333), which should be read in light of the amendment made in the 115th Congress. In the 97th Congress the Speaker announced that personal staff of Members did not have the privilege of the floor (Aug. 18, 1982, p. 21934). Staff permitted on the floor under this clause are not permitted to distribute literature or otherwise attempt to influence Members in their votes (Precedents (Wickham), ch. 4, §5.9; Sept. 27, 1995, p. 26567) and may not applaud during debate (Precedents (Wickham), ch. 4, §5.10).</p>

            <p>Before the House recodified its rules in the 106th Congress, this provision was found in former rule XXXIII (H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 1999, p. 47). It was adopted initially in 1880 (V, 7302) and renumbered January 3, 1953 (p. 24). A gender-based reference was eliminated in the 111th Congress (sec. 2(l), H. Res. 5, Jan. 6, 2009, p. 7).</p>
            <p>On special occasions the House sometimes makes a special rule for admission to the galleries (V, 7303), as on the occasion of the electoral count (III, 1961), of an address by the President, and of public funerals.</p>
